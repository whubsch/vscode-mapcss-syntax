# MapCSS Syntax Highlighter for VS Code

## Overview

This Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension provides syntax highlighting support for the MapCSS language within the VS Code editor. MapCSS is a stylesheet language used primarily in web mapping applications, particularly with OpenStreetMap-based mapping software. This extension is not a linter, but it should help you more easily identify where you have problems in your MapCSS files.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for MapCSS language files and embedded regular expressions.
- Improved code readability with color-coded elements.
- Enhanced development experience for MapCSS stylesheet authors.
- Easily distinguishable properties, selectors, and values.

## Installation

You can install this extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Here's how:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac).
3. Search for "MapCSS Syntax Highlighter."
4. Click the "Install" button to install the extension.
5. Once installed, click the "Reload" button to activate the extension.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed and activated, it will automatically provide syntax highlighting for files with the `.mapcss` extension or when the MapCSS language is selected explicitly in the editor.

Here's how you can enable syntax highlighting manually for a file:

1. Open a MapCSS file (or create a new one with the `.mapcss` extension).
2. In the lower-right corner of the editor, click on the language mode (e.g., "Plain Text" or "HTML").
3. In the dropdown, search for "MapCSS" and select it. This will apply the syntax highlighting.

The extension will now highlight MapCSS syntax elements with appropriate colors, making your code more readable and less error-prone.
